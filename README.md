# TrainScheduler

Hello Train Conductor!  Are you having trouble adding trains to the train schedule?  With this nifty scheduler, easily add incoming trains and keep track of arrivals and departures!

Remember: Anytime is Train Time!  Choo Choo.  Chee Chee.

The biggest challenge for me with this assignment was properly grabbing the user's input and appending it to a table row by row.  I unded up doing a lot of testing because just when I thought I had done it correctly, I would add a calculated column (such as "Next Arrival" or "Minutes Away") and it would mess everything up! For whatever reason, Next Arrival caused me a lot of grief!  I had initially wanted to do a selectable date field for the "First Train Arrival" but I ended up abandoning that feature when I couldn't properly incorporate it with the required calculated fields.  Connecting to Firebase was fairly painless and easy to test.
